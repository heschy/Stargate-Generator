### About

I got the Idea to creata a Stargate-Generator Addon for Blender when I created this by hand (`rendered with Cycles-X`):

#### External Images
I think that I have to say that [the Image I used for the ring](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/StargateSimulator/blob/master/images/ring.png) is from [this Repository](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/StargateSimulator). 
I belive that it is a free-to-use image because [DarceyLloyd](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/) didn't add a licence to the 
repository. [The Image](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/StargateSimulator/blob/master/images/ring.png) will also be used by the addon **if no one asks me to use an other image**.
