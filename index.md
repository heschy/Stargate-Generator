I got the Idea to creata a Stargate-Generator Addon for Blender when i created this by hand:

I think that I have to say that [the Image i used for the ring](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/StargateSimulator/blob/master/images/ring.png) is from [this Repository](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/StargateSimulator). I belive that it is a free-to-use image because [DarceyLloyd](https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/) didn't add a licence to the repository.
